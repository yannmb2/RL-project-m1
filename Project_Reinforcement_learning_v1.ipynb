    "## 🤖 Solution: A PPO-Powered Trading Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a complete Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) pipeline to train an autonomous trading agent. The goal is to develop a policy that outperforms the market by making intelligent decisions on when to go long, short, or stay neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is structured as follows:\n",
    "1.  **Environment Setup & Data Preparation:** We install libraries, load the data, engineer 12 distinct market features, and split the data into chronological `train`, `validation`, and `test` sets.\n",
    "2.  **Baseline Agent:** We establish a \"Random Agent\" baseline to measure our agent's effectiveness.\n",
    "3.  **PPO Agent Implementation:** We build our agent from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with an Actor-Critic network.\n",
    "4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We use `Optuna` to automatically find the best set of hyperparameters (learning rate, network size, etc.) by evaluating models on the `validation` set.\n",
    "5.  **Final Model Training:** We train the agent with the *best* hyperparameters on the *full* training dataset (`df_train_full`).\n",
    "6.  **Final Evaluation & Visualization:** We load the best saved model and run it on the *unseen* `test` set (`df_eval`) to get our final project result."

    "## 4. 🧠 Building the PPO Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core of our project. We are implementing a **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** agent from scratch using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why PPO?\n",
    "PPO is a robust, state-of-the-art algorithm that balances exploration (trying new things) and exploitation (using what works). It uses a \"clipped\" objective function to prevent updates that are too large, which leads to more stable and reliable training than older methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "Our PPO agent consists of two key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`ActorCriticNetwork`:** This single neural network serves two purposes:\n",
    "    * **Actor (Policy):** It decides *what action to take* (e.g., \"go long\", \"go short\"). It outputs a probability distribution over all 9 possible actions.\n",
    "    * **Critic (Value):** It estimates *how good the current state is* (i.e., the expected future reward). It outputs a single value, which helps the Actor learn better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`PPOAgent`:** This class manages the entire learning process. It:\n",
    "    * Holds the `ActorCriticNetwork` and its optimizer.\n",
    "    * Gathers experience from the environment (`store`).\n",
    "    * Calculates advantages using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to determine how much better an action was than expected (`compute_gae`).\n",
    "    * Runs the PPO update logic across multiple epochs to improve the network (`update`)."

    "\n",
    "This function defines a **single trial** for our Optuna hyperparameter search. Its job is to take a set of hyperparameters, train an agent, evaluate it, and return a single score that Optuna will try to maximize.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process works in these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Suggest Hyperparameters:** Optuna provides a `trial` object. We use this object to \"suggest\" a unique combination of hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, and network layers) from the search space we defined (e.g., `lr` between `1e-5` and `1e-3`). This set of parameters is stored in the `ppo_hps` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialize Agent:** A *brand new* `PPOAgent` is created from scratch using the `ppo_hps` for this specific trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Train the Agent:** The new agent is trained for a fixed `TOTAL_TIMESTEPS` (500,000 steps) on our `env_train` (the main training dataset). This is a fast-but-thorough training run to see how well this set of hyperparameters can learn a policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Evaluate on Validation Set:** After training, the agent's performance is measured on the **`env_validation`** (our 3-month validation set). We specifically *do not* use our final `env_eval` test set here. This is critical to prevent data leakage and ensures our final test results are unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Return the Score:** We calculate the agent's average **`mean_excess_return`** (its portfolio return *minus* the market's return) on the validation set. This single number is the final score for the trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optuna will run this function 50 times, each time generating a new set of hyperparameters and getting a new `mean_excess_return`. It will keep track of which hyperparameters produced the highest score."

    "2.  **Create Study:** We create a `study` object and tell it we want to `\"maximize\"` the score.\n",
    "3.  **Run Optimization:** We call `study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)`. This will:\n",
    "    * Call our `objective` function 50 times.\n",
    "    * Each call, it passes in a new set of hyperparameters for the `trial`.\n",
    "    * Our `objective` function trains a temporary agent on `env_train`, evaluates it on `env_validation`, and returns the **mean excess return**.\n",
    "    * Optuna keeps track of which hyperparameters produced the highest excess return.\n",
    "4.  **Get Results:** After the search is complete, the script prints the best score and stores the winning set of hyperparameters in the `best_hps` dictionary.\n",

    "## 🚀 Training the Final Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main training script. After identifying the best hyperparameters with Optuna (`best_hps`), we now use them to train a single, \"production-ready\" agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is designed to be robust and follows standard machine learning practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Consolidate Training Data:** We combine our original `df_train` and `df_validation` sets into one large `df_train_full`. This gives our final agent the maximum amount of data (the full year) to learn from.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize Optimal Agent:** We create a new `PPOAgent` instance using the exact `best_hps` (learning rate, hidden size, etc.) discovered by Optuna.\n",
    "3.  **Train on Full Data:** The agent is trained for a long duration (1 million steps) on the `env_train_full`.\n",
    "4.  **Validate and Save:** Critically, every 5 updates, the agent is evaluated against the **`env_validation`** (the 3-month validation set).\n",
    "5.  **Save Best Model:** We save the agent's network weights *only if* its **mean excess return** (its performance *above* the market) on the validation set improves. This ensures we are not just saving a lucky model, but the one that is most generalizable and best at *beating* the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final saved file, `models/ppo_trading_agent.pth`, will contain the weights of the single best-performing model, ready for the final, unseen test."
