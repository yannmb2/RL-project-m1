    "## Overview\n",
    "In this project, you will implement and evaluate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent in a trading environment. The goal is to train an agent that can make profitable trading decisions based on historical market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to experiment with different DRL algorithms, architectures, and hyperparameters to optimize the agent's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to prepare:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code implementation of the DRL agent(s) and training process. Can be in the form of Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts.\n",
    "- A report (4 pages max) summarizing your approach, results, and insights gained from the project, including:  \n",
    "    - Description of the DRL algorithm(s) used.\n",
    "    - Training process and hyperparameter choices.\n",
    "    - Challenges faced and how they were addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Justify your design choices. You are also encouraged to include visualizations of the agent's performance over time, or compare strategies developed with DRL against financial benchmarks.\n",
    "- An evaluation results CSV file `evaluation_results.csv` generated by your agent after training using the provided evaluation function.\n",
    "- A presentation (15 minutes) to showcase your work, findings, and any interesting observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The documents are to be submitted in a zip file, before 16/11/2025 11:59PM, and the presentation is scheduled for next session.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "We will use Gym Trading Env as our trading environment. (https://gym-trading-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a gymnasium-compatible environment designed to simulate trading (stocks or crypto) from historical market data.\n",
    "- Its goal is to provide a fast and customizable platform for training RL agents in a trading scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use BTC/USDT hour step historical data from Binance for training and evaluation. The agent will be evaluated on the period from 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following code blocks demonstrate how to set up the environment and evaluate your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Criteria\n",
    "- Implementation of the DRL agent and training process (40%)\n",
    "    - DRL algorithm correctly implemented (15%)\n",
    "    - Appropriate training procedure (15%)\n",
    "    - Effective use of hyperparameters (10%)\n",
    "    - 10 % bonus for innovative approaches or techniques\n",
    "- Performance of the agent based on evaluation metrics (30%)\n",
    "    - If the agent shows progress during training (10%)\n",
    "    - If the agent outperforms a random strategy during evaluation (10%)\n",
    "    - If the portfolio return exceeds market return (10%)\n",
    "    - 30%, 20%, 10% bonus for the top 3 agents respectively\n",
    "- Quality and clarity of the report (20%)\n",
    "    - Clear explanation of methods and results (10%)\n",
    "    - Justification of design choices (10%)\n",
    "- Presentation (20%)\n",

    "### Example of interacting with the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction with the environment follows the standard Gymnasium API. At each time step, the agent selects an action (position index) based on the current observation, and the environment returns the next observation, reward, and done flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code block demonstrates a simple interaction loop where the agent randomly selects actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The episode is terminated when `done` or `truncated` is `True`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When environment reaches the end of the dataset, `truncated` is set to `True`.\n",
    "- When agent's portfolio valuation drops below 0, `done` is set to `True`. (This means the agent has gone bankrupt, the situdation can happen when high leverage is used.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward at each time step is calculated based on the change in portfolio valuation, taking into account trading fees and borrow interest rates: $r_{t} = ln(\\frac{p_{t}}{p_{t-1}})\\text{ with }p_{t}\\text{ = portofolio valuation at timestep }t$. You can customize your own reward function if needed (see https://gym-trading-env.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html#custom-reward-function)"
